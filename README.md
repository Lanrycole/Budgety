# This Budgety app was created to calculate montly income and expenses. It was coded in vanilla Javascript. The app was built in a Javacsript as part of the projectsin a Javascript class I enrolled in on Udemy. I also added some extra functionalities to the app. 

You can use any part of this app for your personal projects.
